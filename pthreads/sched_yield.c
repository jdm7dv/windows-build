      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function indicates that the calling thread is
      *      willing to give up some time slices to other threads.
      *      NOTE: Since this is part of POSIX 1003.1b
      *                (realtime extensions), it is defined as returning
      *                -1 if an error occurs and sets errno to the actual
      *                error.
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully created semaphore,
      *              ENOSYS          sched_yield not supported,
